=== Test the deployment

Use a web browser to find the DNS name you provided for the content delivery role.

To log in to Sitecore, retrieve the administrator password by opening AWS Secrets Manager
from within the Region where you deployed this Quick Start. Search for “sitecoreadmin” to
find the password value.

When you have the password, use a web browser to find the DNS name for either the
content delivery role or content management role. Append `/sitecore/admin` to the DNS
name. This displays the login screen where you can log in and configure your Sitecore
environment.
